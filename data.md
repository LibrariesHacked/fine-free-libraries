title: Data
---

A [library fines blog post](https://blog.librarydata.uk/library-fines/) provides information about data for this project.

Data was collected in July 2022. The child and adult fine amounts were added to [a publicly available spreadsheet](https://airtable.com/shr0BL0isrtlaXCnz). If you want to make any changes please email [Libraries Hacked](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org).

The adult fine is the fine someone aged 18 or over would receive for returning a fiction book late. The child fine is the fine someone who is under-18 would receive for returning a fiction book late (**not** specifically child fiction items). The family fine is an estimate of the fine that a family of 4 would receive for returning their books a week late, assuming 1 book each.

The data is free to reuse, and released under a [CC Zero Licence](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
